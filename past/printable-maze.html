    <p>
      The <em>Infinitely Printable Maze</em> is a quine, a program that
      represents its own code, written in PostScript, Adobe's page description
      language from 1982, the language of printers. Unlike a pdf, the Infinitely
      Printable Maze is not a dead document, but draws a different maze each
      time it executes itself during printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why program by hand in PostScript? Why write a program that draws itself
      and thus makes its own form the subject, exposes itself? Why draw itself
      (in/as) a labyrinth, deliberately concealing itself?
    </p>
    <p>
      How reproducible is a document that perfectly reproduces its own code, its
      own instructions, but draws itself differently with each print, making
      each copy unique?
