      Garble is a simple statically typed programming language with a Rust-like
      syntax for
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation"
        >Multi-Party Computation</a
      >
      with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbled_circuit"
        >garbled circuits</a
      >. Garble programs look like Rust programs, but are compiled to boolean
      circuits consisting only of AND, XOR and NOT gates. All programs are
      guaranteed to terminate and always run in a constant time, which is a
      fancy way of saying that the underlying circuits do not have (unbounded)
      loops or (real) jumps / branches. This makes for a
      <a href="https://garble-lang.org/computational_model.html"
        >weird programming model</a
      >, because Garble programs don't execute instructions on a typical von
      Neumann architecture with memory and CPU.

      Apart from its unusual compilation target, Garble is deliberately
      <em>boring</em> and implements a simple subset of Rust (basically Rust
      without references, generics and unbounded loops). Garble stays as close
      to Rust's syntax and semantics as it can, even implementing Rust's

      >.

    <p>Here's how Garble looks like:</p>
    <pre><code>enum Bucket {
    Above,
    Within,
    Below,
}

fn bucket(p: i32, min: i32, max: i32) -> Bucket {
    if p > max {
        Bucket::Above
    } else if p < min {
        Bucket::Below
    } else {
        Bucket::Within
    }
}

pub fn main(x: i32, y: i32, z: i32) -> [Bucket; 3] {
    let avg = (x + y + z) * 1000 / 3;
    let range_in_percent = 10;
    let min = avg * (100 - range_in_percent) / 100;
    let max = avg * (100 + range_in_percent) / 100;
    [
        bucket(x * 1000, min, max),
        bucket(y * 1000, min, max),
        bucket(z * 1000, min, max),
    ]
}</code></pre>
