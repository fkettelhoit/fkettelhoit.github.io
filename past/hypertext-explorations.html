    <h2>Hypertext Explorations</h2>
    <p>
      I built several prototypes of hypertext systems between 2019 and 2023, all
      focused on the idea of linking <em>snippets</em> of text
      <em>implicitly</em> and <em>bidirectionally</em> when they appear in
      different contexts/documents, instead of creating explicit jump-links like
      on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various experiments are attempts to reimagine and prototype a
      different vision of the web as connected and
      <em>overlapping</em> documents/pages/media. The resulting system works
      similar to a wiki and shares a few similarities with Ted Nelson's
      <a href="https://xanadu.com/zigzag/">ZigZag</a>. It grew out of a
      hypertext system for Wittgenstein's philosophical Nachlass, a
      philosophical corpus of 20.000 pages with a strikingly non-linear
      structure. It is also vaguely inspired by Deleuze and Guattari's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)">rhizome</a>
      and McLuhan's notion of acoustic space. One aim of the project was to
      explore how theoretical ideas about non-linear structure can be turned
      into software and used practically.
    </p>
    <h2>Asterion (2023)</h2>
    <p>
      Asterion is an experimental app for non-linear reading and writing that
      links together similar snippets using a <em>subway metaphor</em>, where
      similar snippets form the <em>stations</em> and the documents they appear
      in form the <em>lines</em> that connect them. Whenever a snippet appears
      in different documents, Asterion automatically displays
      <em>bidirectional branches</em> to other documents.

    <p>
      The app is built with Tauri, the similarity search is a custom inverted
      index using n-grams, all data is stored in a simple log-structured KV
      store written in Rust.
    </p>
    <h2>AssemblageDB (2021)</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/fkettelhoit/assemblagedb">AssemblageDB</a> is
      a transactional high-level database for connected webs of pages, notes,
      texts and other media. Think of it like a <em>personal web,</em> but
      easily editable, with more connections and better navigation than the web.
      It is high-level in the sense that it defines a document model similar to
      HTML but vastly simpler and with graph-like 2-way links instead of
      tree-like 1-way jump links. The data model is both:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>document-oriented:</em> supports nested documents without a fixed
        schema
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>graph-based:</em> documents can have multiple parents and form a
        directed graph
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All data is automatically indexed and supports similarity search using an
      inverted index built on n-grams. This allows efficiently finding similar
      snippets, which are linked automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DB is built on top of
      <a
        href="https://github.com/fkettelhoit/assemblagedb/tree/main/assemblage_kv"
        >AssemblageKV</a
      >, a simple embedded key-value store with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control"
        >MVCC</a
      >
      implemented in 100% safe Rust as a log-structured hash table similar to
      <a href="https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf">Bitcask</a>. Writes of
      new or changed values never overwrite old entries, but are simply appended
      to the end of the storage. Old values are kept at earlier offsets in the
      storage and remain accessible. An in-memory hash table tracks the storage
      offsets of all keys and allows efficient reads directly from the relevant
      portions of the storage. A store can be merged, which discards old
      versions and builds a more compact representation containing only the
      latest value of each key.
    </p>
    <h2>Wittgenstein Ãœbersicht (2019)</h2>
    <p>
      I first started working on a hypertext system at the Wittgenstein Archives
      Bergen, built specifically for linking together similar documents and
      snippets in Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophical corpus (consisting of
      about 20 000 pages).
    </p>
    <p>
      The system isn't public available (because the XML sources of the
      Wittgenstein corpus unfortunately haven't been released under an open
      license), but I gave a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX6JYDlJB6U">short talk</a>
      presenting a prototype to a philosophical audience.
