    <p>
      As part of my PhD, I created visualizations of the correspondence between
      Ludwig Wittgenstein's posthumous works (edited by the Nachlass executors)
      and the sources in Wittgenstein's own documents in the Nachlass,
      especially for the <em>Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics</em>.

    <p>Here are some examples:</p>

    <h1>The Problem of Wittgenstein's “Works”</h1>
    <p>
      The “works” of Wittgenstein that were published after his death by the
      three literary executors G.E.M. Anscombe, Rush Rhees and Georg Henrik von
      Wright have often been the target of criticism, giving rise to the
      question of what can even be considered a “work” by Wittgenstein. The
      <em>Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics</em> (RFM), first published
      in 1956 and then heavily revised and expanded in 1974, are certainly one
      of the most problematic publications in this regard, as the literary
      executors themselves pointed out:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The <em>Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics</em> occupy a nearly
        unique, and not altogether happy, position among the posthumous
        publications. In addition to the relatively finished Part I,
        corresponding to typescripts 222, 223, and 224 of the catalogue and
        constituting the second half of the pre-war version of the
        <em>Investigations</em>, the <em>Remarks</em> contain
        <em>selections</em> from several manuscripts (117, 121, 122, 124, 125,
        126, and 127). In the revised edition of 1974 (English translation 1978)
        the selections from those manuscripts were somewhat enlarged and a
        further manuscript (164) which was not known to the editors at the time
        of the first edition was added, practically without omissions. A
        publication of the manuscripts <em>in toto</em>, however, seemed to us
        excluded even at the time of preparing the new edition.
