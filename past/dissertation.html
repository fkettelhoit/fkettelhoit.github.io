    <h1>Consistency and Computation—Wittgenstein on the Diagonal Argument</h1>
    <p>
      From 2019 to 2022, I wrote my PhD dissertation on the philosophy of Ludwig
      Wittgenstein, specifically about his remarks on the three diagonal
      arguments by Cantor, Gödel and Turing and how common interpretations make
      their proofs appear “ultraphysical”, which leads to philosophical
      confusions. Since the various diagonal arguments are fundamental for logic
      and computer science, philosophical misinterpretations shape how we
      understand the foundations of computation.

    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The diagonal arguments by Cantor, Gödel and Turing constitute
        fundamental results that demonstrate limits to what is mathematically
        possible. These results can easily appear to us as limits that
        <em>must</em> hold, as if they were laws of nature that govern the ideal
        world of platonic numbers and logic, giving them an “ultraphysical”
        appearance of rigidity and hardness.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all three cases, Wittgenstein critically examines the formal ideal of
        consistency and points out that the conclusions of the diagonal
        arguments only seem inevitable if we are not prepared to accept the
        contradictory result of the diagonalisation as an object in the formal
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wittgenstein’s intent is not to advocate for a trivialist or
        paraconsistent treatment of inconsistency, since such an interpretation
        of the mathematical results would be just as dogmatic and
        philosophically one-sided as the interpretations that Wittgenstein is
        critically examining. From his perspective, consistency is not an ideal
        in and of itself, but merely a principle that has proven itself so
        useful in a large variety of language games that we accept it as an
        unquestioned rule even in cases where the situation is radically
        different.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics, the actual language games
        that might appear to act only as examples or as motivation for their
        later formalisation are not merely primitive secondary stimuli for the
        primary formal system, they are instead essential for an understanding
        of the formal system to begin with, because the actual language games in
        all their variety lead to a surveyable representation of our concepts in
        a way that does not reveal itself by merely considering the uniform
        treatment in the formal system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wittgenstein’s investigation of the three diagonal arguments shows what
        is at stake in these particular proofs: Although the mathematical proofs
        themselves are perfectly valid, we have the tendency to interpret them
        not as merely demonstrating logical impossibilities, but as
        “ultraphysical” impossibilities, comparable to laws of nature, governing
        the ideal realm of mathematics. Such a misleading picture is the result
        of a “one-sided diet”, because we lack surveyability: We fail to grasp
        the concepts in all their various uses and in the context of how they
        fit into our form of life. The antidote is to describe them in a
        surveyable representation, sometimes by imagining different forms of
        life.

      The dissertation also contains visualizations of how the posthumously
      published <em>Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics</em> is related to
      the various source documents in Wittgenstein's Nachlass (more details
