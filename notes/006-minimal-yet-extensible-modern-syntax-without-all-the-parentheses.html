    <h1>Minimal Yet Extensible Modern Syntax (Without All the Parentheses)</h1>
    <p>
      This is a proposal for a programming language syntax that is both modern
      and familiar to anyone used to C/JS-style languages with curly braces, yet
      minimal and extensible enough that all control structures, including
      conditionals and variable declarations, can be implemented as normal
      functions and redefined at will.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is similarly minimal and flexible as Lisp, but does not rely on macros
      and uses parentheses a lot more sparingly. Other approaches that I'm aware
      of include
      <a href="https://readable.sourceforge.io/">Sweet expressions</a> in Lisp,
      <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/optional-syntax.html"
        >keyword lists</a
      >
      in Elixir and the
      <a href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#why-mingen"
        >minimal but general</a
      >
      syntax of Koka.
    </p>
    <p>
      (This proposal builds on the idea of
      <a href="./003-custom-binding-constructs-without-macros.html"
        >explicit bindings</a
      >
      and last week's
      <a href="./005-custom-binding-constructs-without-macros-3.html"
        >note on syntax</a
      >, but is self-contained and links back where necessary.)
    </p>
    <p>The end result looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>// user-defined variable declaration, `=` is just a function:
'x = "foo"
'y = "bar"
f(x, y)

// user-defined pattern matching, `match` and `->` are just functions:
match (x) [
    Pair('x, 'x) -> { f(x) }
    'x           -> { g() }
]

// user-defined if-else, `if` and `==` are just functions:
if (x == y) {
    f()
} else {
    g(x, y)
}</code></pre>
    <h1>The Starting Point: Curried Functions</h1>
    <p>
      Let's start with a minimal functional language with variables, anonymous
      functions and function application. Basically lambda calculus, but with
      slightly different syntax:
    </p>
    <pre><code>x           // variable x
f(x)        // function f called with argument x
{ 'x => x } // anonymous function with argument x, returning x</code></pre>
    <p>
      Variables and function calls work just like in C/JS-like languages, while
      the syntax for anonymous functions is borrowed from
      <a
        href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html#lambda-expressions-and-anonymous-functions"
        >Kotlin's lambdas</a
      >, except with “=>” instead of “->”, and the variable that is being bound
      is written as 'x instead of x.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multi-argument functions can be simulated by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a>:
    </p>
    <pre><code>f(a)(b)(c)</code></pre>
    <h1>Tags: Foo, "foo", "foo bar"</h1>
    <p>
      Right now there is no way to represent data, which might be enough for
      lambda calculus, but insufficient for a real programming language. Let's
      add <em>tags</em> (called
      <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.12/Atom.html">atoms</a>,
      <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/data_structures#Keywords"
        >keywords</a
      >
      or
      <a
        href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Symbol+Literals"
        >symbols</a
      >
      in other languages), which are
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning"
        >interned strings</a
      >
      / atomic values that just represent themselves, written like variables but
      starting with an uppercase letter. Data structures can be built by
      applying tags to values:
    </p>
    <pre><code>Foo           // the tag Foo,
              // an interned atomic value

Foo(Bar)      // Foo applied to Bar,
              // basically struct Foo with field Bar

Foo(Bar)(Baz) // Foo applied to Bar, then applied to Baz,
              // basically a struct Foo with fields Bar and Baz</code></pre>
    <p>
      It is possible to have tags that do not start with an uppercase letter or
      that contain whitespace by explicitly wrapping a tag in "...":
    </p>
    <pre><code>"foo"
"foo bar"
"Foo" // same as `Foo`</code></pre>
    <h1>Lists: [...]</h1>
    <p>
      While tags make it possible to build arbitrary data structures, sometimes
      we simply want a collection of values without tagging it with an explicit
      name, so let's add syntax for lists:
    </p>
    <pre><code>[Foo, Bar, Baz]</code></pre>
    <h1>Side Effects: (), f(), { ... }</h1>
    <p>
      Right now there are no “zero argument” functions, each call needs an
      explicit argument. But in a language with side effects, there might be
      functions that don't care about their argument, so let's define a special
      nil value “()” and define that “f()” is sugar for calling f with the nil
      value:
    </p>
    <pre><code>()  // special nil tag
f() // sugar for f(())</code></pre>
    <p>
      Additionally, an anonymous function { ... } that does not declare a
      variable using “'x => ...” will be treated like a function that simply
      ignores its argument:
    </p>
    <pre><code>{ f(y) } // sugar for `{ 'x => f(y) }`</code></pre>
    <h1>Prefix Calls: f(a, b, c) [...] {...}</h1>
    <p>
      Calling a function f with three arguments a, b and c as “f(a)(b)(c)” is a
      bit unfamiliar coming from C/JS-like languages, so let's define some sugar
      that can be used both for functions and tags:
    </p>
    <pre><code>f(a, b, c)     // sugar for `f(a)(b)(c)`
Pair(Foo, Bar) // sugar for `Pair(Foo)(Bar)`</code></pre>
    <p>
      Trailing arguments are allowed: Whenever [...] or {...} appear as
      arguments of a function call, they can be written <em>after</em> the
      closing parenthesis instead. Trailing arguments cannot be followed by
      (...), only by further [...] or {...}. The parentheses after a function
      call can be omitted if all arguments are trailing arguments.
    </p>
    <pre><code>f(a) { 'x => x }        // sugar for `f(a, { 'x => x })`
f(a) [b, c] { 'x => x } // sugar for `f(a, [b, c], { 'x => x })`
f [a, b]                // sugar for `f([a, b])`
f { Bar } { Baz }       // sugar for `f({ Bar }, { Baz })`

f { Bar }(x)  // not allowed, (x) appears after trailing arg</code></pre>
    <h1>Piped Calls: a.f(b, c) [...] {...}</h1>
    <p>
      It is often natural to express computations as a chain of operations
      applied to a value, transforming the value step by step. Instead of a
      <a
        href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/enumerable-and-streams.html#the-pipe-operator"
        >pipe operator</a
      >
      or
      <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/threading_macros">threading macro</a>,
      let's just use
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax"
        >uniform function call syntax</a
      >:
    </p>
    <pre><code>a.f1(b, c).f2(d) // sugar for `f2(f1(a, b, c), d)`</code></pre>
    <p>
      Piped calls are just prefix calls whose first argument is written on the
      left of the function, so piped calls support [...] and {...} as trailing
      arguments.
    </p>
    <h1>Infix Calls: a f b</h1>
    <p>
      It would be nice to be able to use infix functions without any
      parentheses, such as “a + b” or “a == b”. So let's add some sugar for
      that:
    </p>
    <pre><code>a f b // sugar for `f(a, b)`</code></pre>
    <p>
      How should we deal with chained infix calls such as “a + b + c”? Are infix
      calls left-associative, right-associative or can this be defined? Let's
      keep it simple and always require parentheses for chaining infix calls:
    </p>
    <pre><code>(a - b) - c   // sugar for `-(-(a, b), c)`
a -> (b -> c) // sugar for `->(a, ->(b, c))`</code></pre>
    <p>
      Let's also require that while the arguments a and b of can be arbitrary
      expressions (that might have to be wrapped in (...) if they are infix
      calls), the function f must be always be a
      <em>variable</em>, never a composite expression.
    </p>
    <h1>Keyword Calls: f (a) { ... } else { ... }</h1>
    <p>
      Requiring infix functions to be variables makes it possible to have
      <em>keywords calls</em>, which are similar to Elixir's
      <a
        href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/keywords-and-maps.html#do-blocks-and-keywords"
        >Optional keyword lists</a
      >: Whenever a <em>variable</em> f is followed by a (...), [...] or {...}
      (ensuring that it's not an infix call), all variables that follow are
      treated as “keywords” and passed to the function f as a list of tags and
      their argument(s). Let's look at an example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>if (x) { // the variable `if` is followed by a non-variable `(x)`...
    f()
} elif (y) { //...so `elif` is treated as a keyword...
    g()
} else { // ...and so is `else`...
    h()
}

// ...and the above is desugared to:
if(
    x,
    { f() },
    [
        ["elif", y, { g() }],
        ["else", { h() }]
    ]
)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Having 4 different ways to call functions (prefix call, piped call, infix
      call and keyword call) might seem excessive, but it's usually easy to know
      which one to pick:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Prefix calls like f(a, b) make up most of the calls in a program and are
        the “bread and butter” calls, used whenever the other options don't
        apply.
      </li>
      <li>
        Piped calls are useful whenever a value is transformed in multiple
        steps, as a pipeline of operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Infix calls should be more rarely used, usually only for “mathy”
        functions and core syntax like “->” and “=>”.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keyword calls should be even more sparingly used, usually only for
        control structures and core syntax.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Explicit Bindings and {...}</h1>
    <p>
      It might seem strange to make the bound variable of an anonymous function
      explicit by writing { 'x => x } instead of just { x => x }, but making
      bindings such as 'x explicit allows us to define => as a normal function
      instead of a built-in part of the syntax. Here's how:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// the "anonymous function" syntax:
{ 'x => x }
// ...is sugar for:
'x => { x } 
// ...which is sugar for:
=>('x, { x })</code></pre>
    <p>
      Bindings are made explicit by quoting a variable x as 'x. Any unquoted
      variable is resolved as normal, but a quoted variable is a binding, a
      “variable to be”, which is not resolved in the current context, but will
      be bound in the nearest block, which is delimited by { ... }.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blocks are just syntactic sugar for anonymous functions, whose parameters
      are defined by the explicit bindings that appear to their left in the
      code. In the above example, the block { x } would be translated to an
      anonymous function of one argument x that just returns x.
    </p>
    <p>
      To separate “surface syntax” (which includes functions like => and { ... }
      blocks) and the anonymous functions that they are translated to, the
      following examples will use the non-surface syntax notation “x ===> x” for
      an anonymous function that returns its argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      More explicitly, whenever a function f is called with a block as its
      argument, this function acts as a “binder”: The block will consume all the
      bindings that occur as arguments of f (or as arguments to arguments of f
      and so forth) before the block. A block never receives bindings that come
      from “above” the binder f in the syntax tree, which makes binders act as
      scopes (more details
      <a href="./003-custom-binding-constructs-without-macros.html">here</a>):
    </p>
    <pre><code>// this binds `x ===> x + x` to f, then calls f(Y)
let('f, 'x => { x + x }, { f(Y) })
//   |   \____________/          |
//   |     scope of x            |
//   \___________________________/
//           scope of f
//
// { x + x } is translated to `x ===> x + x`
// { f(Y) } is translated to `f ===> f(Y)`</code></pre>
    <h1>Nested Blocks: {..., ...}</h1>
    <p>
      Let's add a bit more syntactic sugar: Right now blocks always have to be
      used <em>after</em> the explicit bindings that the block is supposed to
      consume, but it makes sense to also allow blocks to consume bindings by
      <em>enclosing</em> bindings:
    </p>
    <pre><code>{ 'x = y, f(x) }</code></pre>
    <p>
      Whenever explicit bindings are declared inside a block but not consumed
      until the end of the block, the bindings will be consumed by the enclosing
      block, as if everything that follows the call with the explicit bindings
      had been passed as a block right then. The above example will be desugared
      to “=('x, y, { f(x) })”. In other words, instead of passing a block as the
      last argument of a function call, we can just use that function inside the
      block. This is especially helpful for nested bindings:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// desugars to: =('a, x, { =('b, y, { Pair(a, b) }) })
{ 'a = x, 'b = y, Pair(a, b) }</code></pre>
    <p>
      This assumes that every element in a block will be a binding construct
      that knows how to handle the block argument that is implicitly passed to
      it. But especially in a language with side effects it would be nice to
      allow block elements to not bind anything at all and just “do” something,
      like print(x).
    </p>
    <p>
      To allow this, whenever a block element does not contain any explicit
      bindings that could be consumed by the enclosing block, the element will
      be evaluated (call-by-value) as an argument to an anonymous function,
      which when called will return the rest of the block:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// binding construct, uses the binding 'x:
{ 'x = Foo, ... } // translates to: `=('x, Foo, x ===> ...)`

// side effect, does not use the binding:
{ f(), ... } // translates to: `(_ ===> ...)(f())`</code></pre>
    <p>This makes it easy to mix binding constructs and side effects:</p>
    <pre><code>// translates to: =('a, x, { (_ ===> f(a))(print(a)) })
{ 'a = x, print(a), f(a) }</code></pre>
    <p>
      Lastly, a program is treated as a {...} block without the “{” and “}” at
      the start/end:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// sugar for `{ 'x = "foo", 'y = "bar", f(x, y) }`:
'x = "foo"
'y = "bar"
f(x, y)</code></pre>
    <h1>Separators: Commas or Newlines</h1>
    <p>
      Functions calls, [...] and {...} all assume that their elements are
      separated by commas. Let's treat commas and newlines interchangeably as
      separators, let's allow separators at the beginning and end of calls,
      [...] and {...}, and let's treat multiple successive separators as a
      single separator:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// sugar for `[Foo(Bar, { f, g }), Baz]`:
[
    Foo(
        Bar
        {
            f
            g
        }
    )
    Baz
]</code></pre>
    <h1>Putting it All Together</h1>
    <p>Using all of this syntactic sugar, we can see how...</p>
    <pre><code>match (x) [
  Pair('x, 'x) -> { f(x) }
  'x           -> { g() }
]</code></pre>
    <p>...is sugar for...</p>
    <pre><code>match(x)([
    ->(Pair('x)('x))({ 'x => f(x) }),
    ->('x)({ 'y => g(()) })
])</code></pre>
    <p>Using keyword calls, the code...</p>
    <pre><code>// user-defined if-else, `if` and `==` are just functions:
if (x == y) {
    f()
} else {
    g(x, y)
}</code></pre>
    <p>...is sugar for...</p>
    <pre><code>if(
    ==(x)(y)
)(
    { 'x => f(()) }
)([
    ["else", { 'z => g(x)(y) }]
])</code></pre>
    <h1>Possible Extensions</h1>
    <p>
      While the above syntax makes up the core of the proposal, there are a
      couple of extensions that could be added while keeping the syntax minmal
      yet extensible:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        “<strong>f a</strong>”: Just like infix calls are a special case of
        function calls and cannot be chained, it would be possible to treat “f
        a” as the call “f(a)”. Would save a couple of parentheses and doesn't
        conflict with other syntax, but maybe not worth the little bit of extra
        complexity.
      </li>
      <li>
        “<strong>a: b</strong>”: It is common to build data structures of keys
        and values, but right now there is no syntax for maps. A simple yet
        general addition in this direction could be “x: y” as sugar for “[x,
        y]”. Just like infix calls, pairs cannot be chained without explicit
        parentheses and cannot be used in infix calls, to avoid precedence
        issues in cases such as “a f x: y”.
      </li>
      <li>
        “<strong>f Foo Set(Bar, Baz)</strong>”: Only [...] and {...} can
        currently be used as trailing arguments, which privileges lists compared
        to other data structures that are built using tags, such as “Set(Bar,
        Baz)”. It is tempting to allow data structures as trailing arguments,
        which would however require treating parentheses after trailing
        arguments as being arguments to the trailing argument, not the function
        call. Another problem is that such a call looks too much like a keyword
        call.
      </li>
    </ul>
