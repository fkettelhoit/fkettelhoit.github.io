# RC week 10: reasonable macros through explicit bindings

Another week, another paper at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), focused on macros (and already implemented in Kombucha). This time without a specific workshop in mind, more as an exercise to collect the macro explorations from the previous weeks in one place and abstract it a bit from the specific system used in Kombucha. Here's the abstract:

_We present macros that can be statically reasoned about without requiring a macro expansion phase. This is achieved by distinguishing variables that are being_ bound _from variables that are being_ used, _in combination with_ explicit block scopes. _The resulting macro system enables_ local reasoning, _by supporting local evaluation without requiring full knowledge of the macros in scope._

Here's the [paper](../papers/reasonable-macros-through-explicit-bindings.pdf).
