This time without a specific workshop in mind, more as an exercise to collect the macro explorations from the previous weeks in one place and abstract it a bit from the specific system used in Kombucha. Here's the abstract:</p><p><em>We present macros that can be statically reasoned about without requiring a macro expansion phase. This is achieved by distinguishing variables that are being</em> bound <em>from variables that are being</em> used, <em>in combination with</em> explicit block scopes. <em>The resulting macro system enables</em> local reasoning, <em>by supporting local evaluation without requiring full knowledge of the macros in scope.</em></p><p>Here's the <a href="../papers/reasonable-macros-through-explicit-bindings.pdf">paper</a>.</p></body></html>
