        [&quot;Kombucha is quite minimal, closer to a (purely functional) Lisp (with effect handlers) than most other languages, but it does support quite a bit of syntactic sugar, which is general enough that applies to all functions and data structures.

        [&quot;Notice also how the page description, which is data, contains a call to the &quot;, Code(&quot;quine!&quot;), &quot; effect, which suspends execution of the VM, loads the file that is being processed (using the Rust host) and then resume the VM with the code as a string.
