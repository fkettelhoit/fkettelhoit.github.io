    <h1>RC Week 2:<br />Pattern Matching, VM Instruction Set</h1>
    <p>
      Another week has flown by at the
      <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, where I managed to
      tie up a couple of loose threads related to
      <a href="./013-rc-week-1-vorpal-a-minimal-and-malleable-language.html"
        >Vorpal</a
      >, the programming that I'm building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vorpal is now in a state where I can use it to write programs with a
      syntax close to what I'm eventually envisioning. This requires a bit of
      bootstrapping, as Vorpal's core language does not provide any operator for
      deep equality, let alone anything resembling pattern matching. This is by
      design, however, because one of the goals is to be extensible enough that
      such language constructs can be added in the language using macros.
    </p>
    <h1>Bootstrapping Pattern Matching</h1>
    <p>
      That's what I did this week, going from a level of abstraction similar to
      lambda calculus to pattern matching with unification. Here's the end
      result:
    </p>
    <pre><code>match: Pair(Foo, Bar) with: [
    Pair('x, 'x) -> { Twice(x, x) }
    Pair('x, Foo) -> { SecondIsFoo }
    Pair('x, 'y) -> { y }
    '_ -> { throw!(InvalidPair) }
]</code></pre>
    <p>
      The prelude (the small set of functions that are by default included in
      every Vorpal program) now defines the two functions “match-with” (which
      can be called using a Smalltalk-like keyword call syntax as “match: ...
      with: ...”) and “->” (which expects a pattern and a body and returns a
      function that takes a value and executes the body if the pattern matches
      the value).
    </p>
    <h1>Bytecode Instruction Format</h1>
    <p>
      I settled on an instruction set for Vorpal's
      <a href="./010-stack-based-bytecode-vm-for-vorpal.html"
        >stack-based bytecode VM</a
      >. It's definitely not the most efficient one, but simple to implement,
      which is more important for my purposes. There are currently 11
      instructions (with plans to stick to a maximum of 16 instructions in the
      long term) with variable lengths ranging from 1 to 4 bytes:
    </p>
    <pre><code>| NAME       | BYTE 1   | BYTE 2   | BYTE 3   | BYTE 4   |
+------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| LOAD_FN    | TAG | --FN_INDEX-------------- | --VARS-- |
| LOAD_STR   | TAG | --STRING_INDEX---------- |
| LOAD_EFF   | TAG | --STRING_INDEX---------- |
| LOAD_VAR   | TAG | --VAR_INDEX-- |
| APPLY_PRE  | TAG | -- |
| APPLY_POST | TAG | -- |
| RETURN     | TAG | -- |
| CMP        | TAG | -- |
| UNPACK     | TAG | -- |
| TRY        | TAG | -- |
| UNWIND     | TAG | -- |</code></pre>
    <p>Here's what the instructions do:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        LOAD_FN looks up a function in the bytecode stream (using a 20 bit
        FN_INDEX), associates it with the number of variables (VARS, up to 255)
        that the function might capture as a closure, then pushes the function
        onto the intermediate stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        LOAD_STRING looks up a string in the string section of the bytecode
        (using a 20 bit STRING_INDEX) and pushes it onto the intermediate stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        LOAD_EFFECT looks up the name of an effect in the string section of the
        bytecode (using a 20 bit STRING_INDEX) and pushes it onto the
        intermediate stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        LOAD_VAR clones a variable from the variable stack (using a 12 bit
        index) and pushes it onto the intermediate stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        APPLY_PRE pops an argument from the intermediate stack, pops a function
        from the intermediate stack, then applies the function to the argument.
      </li>
      <li>
        APPLY_POST pops a function from the intermediate stack, pops an argument
        from the intermediate stack, then applies the function to the argument.
      </li>
      <li>
        RETURN marks the end of the current function, pops the current call
        frame and jumps to the return address stored there.
      </li>
      <li>
        CMP pops an if-false branch, pops an if-true branch, pops two values
        (all from the intermediate stack) and then applies if-true to the nil
        value if the two values are the same strings, otherwise applies
        if-branch to the nil value. (This acts as a simple if-then-else without
        deep equality.)
      </li>
      <li>
        UNPACK pops an if-false branch, pops an if-true branch, pops a compound
        value (all from the intermediate stack), then applies the if-true branch
        to the compound value split into its last part and everything before it
        (as two separate arguments), or applies if-false to the nil value if the
        value is not a compound value.
      </li>
      <li>
        TRY pops an effect handler, an effect and a function (all from the
        intermediate stack), pushes the effect handler to the handler stack,
        then applies the function to the nil value (while the handler is
        active).
      </li>
      <li>UNWIND pops an effect handler from the handler stack.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Fixed-Point Combinator + Recursion</h1>
    <p>
      I got rid of a special instruction for recursion. There is still a
      recursion combinator in the intermediate (lambda-like) calculus, but the
      combinator is then compiled into a simple fixed-point function using the
      following code, which is guaranteed to be placed at offset 0 in the list
      of operators:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// fix = f => x => f(fix(f))(x)
let mut bytecode = vec![
    // 0: f => ...
    Op::LoadFn { code: 2, fvars: 1 },
    Op::Return,
    // 2: ... x => f(fix(f))(x)
    Op::LoadVar(1),                   // f
    Op::LoadFn { code: 0, fvars: 0 }, // f, fix
    Op::LoadVar(1),                   // f, fix, f
    Op::ApplyPrefix,                  // f, fix(f)
    Op::ApplyPrefix,                  // f(fix(f))
    Op::LoadVar(0),                   // f(fix(f)), x
    Op::ApplyPrefix,                  // f(fix(f))(x)
    Op::Return,
];</code></pre>
