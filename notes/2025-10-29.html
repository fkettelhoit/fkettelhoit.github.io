Is it AI slop if the papers are recognizably our ideas, just using a more academic language? How much of academia has always been AI slop without the AI?</strong></p><h2>If there's a problem, add another bot</h2><p>The project started simple enough: what if we automated the entire academic pipeline? Graduate student bots summarize conversations. Postdoc bots rate relevance. Research assistant bots find supporting episodes. A professor bot writes the paper. Reviewer bots accept or reject it.</p><p>If rejected, the paper goes back to the professor for revisions. The cycle continues until all papers are accepted. It takes about five hours to generate a full conference, with built-in pauses for rate limits (and to let the grad students rest, of course).</p><p>The result? Papers with titles like <em>“Maternal Panic and Mob Mentality in 3x11 'Gingerbread': A Nietzschean Analysis of Slave Morality”</em> and <em>“Hyperreality and Baudrillard in Buffy's 6x17 'Normal Again': The Asylum as Simulation.”</em></p><p>They're deeply sincere. Rigorously argued. Completely automated. And based entirely on two people texting about TV.</p><p>(I know this sounds like a joke, but the papers are actually pretty close to some of our core ideas about philosophical readings of Buffy.)</p><h2>Printed on a Laserjet 4000 in 2003</h2><p>But we didn't just want the papers to <em>feel</em> academic. We wanted the entire website to look like it had been photocopied in a basement office in 2003, left in a filing cabinet for twenty years, then scanned by someone who couldn't quite get the pages straight.</p><p>The key to the degraded photocopy look of the website came from SVG displacement filters applied to our typography. We used two primary open source typefaces: <em>Xanh Mono</em> for headings and <em>Nimbus Mono</em> for body text, and ran them through custom filters that simulate the way toner spreads and warps on photocopied paper.</p><p>The magic happens in the <code>feDisplacementMap</code> element, which pushes pixels around based on the turbulence pattern. (We are using different filters for headings and body, as well as for high-res and low-res displays.) It's the digital equivalent of a photocopier's toner bleeding and shifting as it heats the paper.</p><p>The papers themselves needed to feel like physical documents: slightly crooked, a bit noisy, with that characteristic barrel distortion from scanning equipment that's seen better days. This is where a simple bash script using <code>imagemagick</code> comes in, which...</p><ul><li>Converts each PDF page to a high-res PNG (200 DPI)</li><li>Randomly rotates each page between -0.9° and 0.9° (just enough to look hand-scanned, not enough to be annoying)</li><li>Adds multiplicative noise with random intensity to simulate paper texture</li><li>Applies a wave distortion to create that ripple effect from pages that weren't perfectly flat</li><li>Adds barrel distortion (that subtle fisheye effect from scanner optics)</li><li>Converts to grayscale because of course these would have been printed on a black-and-white copier in 2003</li></ul><p>The rotation varies per page, so even within a single paper, no two pages sit at quite the same angle. It's the kind of detail that sells the fiction—these documents have been handled, copied, scanned, and archived by people who had better things to do than ensure perfect alignment.</p><h2>Explore the conference</h2><p>You can explore the full conference at <a href="https://slayerfest.org">slayerfest.org</a>, where all eight accepted papers are available for download (complete with scanned authenticity and peer review history, of course).</p><footer>Want to become a better programmer? <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=764048f99cede394c1905c64e1545a5d">Join the Recurse Center!</a></footer></body></html>
