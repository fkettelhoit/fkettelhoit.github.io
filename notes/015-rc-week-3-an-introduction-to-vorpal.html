    <h2>RC Week 3:<br />A Gentle Introduction to Vorpal</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="./013-rc-week-1-vorpal-a-minimal-and-malleable-language.html"
        >Vorpal</a
      >
      is a minimal and malleable programming language, which I'm building during
      my 12 weeks at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>.
      Here's what it looks like:
    </p>
    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments start with // and end at the end of the line.</p>
    <pre><code>// This is a comment.</code></pre>
    <h2>Strings + Atoms</h2>
    <p>
      The only basic data type that Vorpal provides are strings. Strings might
      be composite data types in other languages, but from the perspective of
      Vorpal each string is an <em>atomic value:</em> You can check whether one
      string is equal to another, but there are no operations to manipulate
      strings. (Vorpal strings are interned, just like symbols in Ruby, atoms in
      Elixir and keywords in Clojure.)
    </p>
    <p>There are two string-like data types:</p>
    <pre><code>// Strings are wrapped in double quotes:

"a string"
#"raw strings can contain " characters"#
##"this raw string contains a #" in the string"##

// Capitalized identifiers are string-like atoms:
Foo
BarBaz</code></pre>
    <p>
      While Foo and "Foo" are both represented as strings under the hood, they
      are different values. Uppercase identifiers are called atoms,
      double-quoted strings are just called strings.
    </p>
    <h2>Compounds</h2>
    <p>
      Strings and atoms can be applied to each other to form ad-hoc compound
      data structures without the need to define any types beforehand. An atom
      Foo applied to the two atoms X and Y can be thought of as a
      <em>record</em> Foo with two positional fields holding the atoms X and Y.
    </p>
    <pre><code>// A record Foo containing X and Y:
Foo(X, Y)

// A Pair of two other records:
Pair(Section(X, Y), Paragraph(Z))</code></pre>
    <h2>[] + Lists</h2>
    <p>
      The empty atom is written [] and represents an empty list. Lists of values
      can be built by successively applying [] to values,
      <em>with the first value of the list as the last applied value:</em>
    </p>
    <pre><code>[Foo, Bar, Baz] // ...is the same as:
[](Baz, Bar, Foo) // ...which is the same as:
(([](Baz))(Bar))(Foo)</code></pre>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Function names start with non-uppercase ASCII characters (otherwise they
      would be atoms). Here's an example of a function f being applied to the
      two atoms Foo and Bar:
    </p>
    <pre><code>f(Foo, Bar)</code></pre>
    <p>Functions can also be applied using infix notation:</p>
    <pre><code>Foo f Bar // ...is the same as f(Foo, Bar)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Every function can be applied using infix notation. All infix functions
      have the same precedence and it is invalid to use different infix
      functions in the same expression without grouping their parts using (...).
    </p>
    <pre><code>(X f Y) g Z // ...is ok, but X f Y g Z would be invalid.
X f Y f Z   // ...is ok and parsed as (X f Y) f z.</code></pre>
    <p>
      Vorpal supports a third way of calling functions, keyword calls, which are
      especially useful for control structures (which are just regular functions
      in Vorpal). A function named foo-bar-baz can be called as foo: arg1 bar:
      arg2 baz: arg3, which Vorpal will splice together as foo-bar-baz(arg1,
      arg2, arg3).
    </p>
    <pre><code>foo: X bar: Y baz: Z // ...is the same as foo-bar-baz(X, Y, Z)
foo: X bar: Y        // ...is the same as foo-bar(X, Y)
foo: Bar             // ...is the same as foo(Bar)</code></pre>
    <p>
      This means that a single argument function f(x) can always be called as f:
      X.
    </p>
    <p>Nested keyword calls must be grouped using (...):</p>
    <pre><code>foo: (bar: X baz: Y) qux: Z</code></pre>
    <p>
      Lastly, f(x, y, z) is just sugar for ((f(x))(y))(z), in other words f(x,
      y, z) is sugar for <em>currying</em>, the repeated application of a
      function to a single argument.
    </p>
    <h2>Variables + Bindings</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      All variables start with non-uppercase ASCII characters (otherwise they
      would be atoms). A variable can be assigned using the = function, which
      expects a <em>binding</em>, which is the name of a variable prefixed with
      “:”. Here's an example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>:x = Foo // Assigns the atom Foo to the variable x.
:y = x   // Assigns the value of the variable x to the variable y.</code></pre>
    <p>
      Why does Vorpal distinguish bindings and variables instead of just using y
      = x like other languages? In Vorpal, the = function is just a regular
      function and the :x syntax signals that x is not being <em>used</em>, it
      is being <em>bound</em>. This might look superfluous here, but will come
      in handy later on.
    </p>
    <h2>Blocks</h2>
    <p>
      New function can be defined using the => function, which binds one or more
      variables on the left-hand side to a function body enclosed in {...} on
      the right-hand side:
    </p>
    <pre><code>:x => { f(x) }          // A single argument function with body f(x).
[:x, :y] => { f(x, y) } // A function of two arguments x and y.</code></pre>
    <p>
      The {...} part is called a <em>block</em> and can contain variable
      definitions separated by commas or newlines. A block always evaluates to
      the last expression in the block:
    </p>
    <pre><code>:x => {
    :y = f(x)
    :z = g(y, y)
    Pair(z, z) // This is the return value of the function.
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      A Vorpal program is a collection of expressions that are implicitly
      wrapped in {...}.
    </p>
    <h2>Recursion</h2>
    <p>
      Recursive functions can be built using the ~> function, which binds a
      variable to itself:
    </p>
    <pre><code>:f ~> {
    // Inside of this block, f is bound to itself.
    [:x, :y] => {
        f(x, y) // This will call f recursively (and never terminate).
    }
}</code></pre>
    <h2>Pattern Matching</h2>
    <p>
      Apart from =, => and ~>, the most useful function provided by Vorpal are
      the pattern matching functions -> and match-with:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// match: ... with: ... is a keyword call for match-with
match: x with: [
    Foo(Bar, Baz) -> { "just Foo(Bar, Baz)" }
    Foo(:x, :x) -> { twice(x) }
    Foo(:x, y) -> { "the second element is the value of y" }
]</code></pre>
    <p>
      Notice how y is used as a <em>value</em>, not as a <em>binding</em>. The
      last clause of the pattern match only succeeds if the second element of
      Foo has the value y, whereas the first element of Foo is <em>bound</em> to
      the variable x, not matter what the element's value is.
    </p>
    <h2>Effects</h2>
    <p>
      What happens when no pattern matches the value? This is an example of an
      <em>effect</em>, which is like an exception that can be resumed by its
      exception handler (if desired). Effects look like function names, but
      always end with “!” and do not need to defined before being used. What
      happens when an effect is called depends on which
      <em>effect handler</em> has been (dynamically) installed. If there is no
      effect handler, the execution will stop and the effect will bubble up all
      the way to the (Rust) host, which can then handle the effect and resume
      the execution.
    </p>
    <pre><code>// This will bubble up to the Rust host:
throw!("throwing something without a handler")

// This will evaluate to Bar(Twice(x, x)):
try: {
  match: x with: [
    Pair(:x, :x) -> {
      Foo(Twice(x, x))
    }
    :value -> {
      // The not-equal! effect will be handled.
      Bar(not-equal!(value))
    }
  ]
} catch: not-equal! as: [:resume, :arg] => {
  // We handle it by resuming execution:
  resume(Twice(arg, arg))
}</code></pre>
    <h2>Commas and Newlines</h2>
    <p>
      One last thing to point out is that commas and newlines are completely
      interchangeable in Vorpal. Every (...), [...] and {...} can contain one or
      more commas/newlines before and after each element (including leading or
      trailing commas/newlines), but elements must be separated by at least one
      comma or newline.
    </p>
    <pre><code>// [Foo, Bar]
[
    Foo
    Bar
]

// f(Foo, Bar)
f(
  Foo
  Bar
)

// { :x = Foo, :y = Bar }
{
  :x = Foo
  :y = Bar
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Commas/newlines are <em>not</em> allowed immediately after keywords ending
      in “:”.
