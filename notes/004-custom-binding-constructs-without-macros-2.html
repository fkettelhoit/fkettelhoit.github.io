    <h1>
      Custom Binding Constructs Without Macros, Part 2: Desugaring Bindings
    </h1>
    <p>
      (This is a continuation of
      <a href="./003-custom-binding-constructs-without-macros.html"
        >last week's experiment</a
      >.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's assume we want to implement our own pattern matching functionality
      in a language that does not provide such a functionality and define a
      custom “match” function:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// print x only if v is a pair with 1 as its second field
let v = Pair(2, 1);
match(v, Pair(x, 1), { print(x) })</code></pre>
    <p>
      In most languages we're out of luck, because matching a pattern such as
      Pair(x, 1) against a value involves <em>binding</em> the first element of
      the value to the variable x in the scope of the match clause, but as soon
      as the argument Pair(x, 1) is passed to the match function, the variable x
      will be evaluated in the current scope instead of being used as a name
      that we want to bind to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisp macros provide a solution, but they come at a cost: Macros operate on
      a syntactic level <em>before</em> variables are resolved and can interpret
      variables in any way they wish, even behaving differently based on the
      name of a symbol. This makes macros powerful, but goes against our
      intuition of how variables are used: Renaming a variable should never
      change program behavior. Can we do better?
    </p>
    <h1>Explicit Bindings</h1>
    <p>
      Here's a proposal for how custom binding constructs could be defined
      without bringing in full macros, in other words, without exposing the
      names of variables to a macro:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// 'x is an explicit binding, used in the nearest block { ... }
match(v, Pair('x, 'x), { x })</code></pre>
    <p>
      Bindings are made explicit by quoting a variable x as 'x. Any unquoted
      variable is resolved as normal, but a quoted variable is a binding, a
      “variable to be”, which is not resolved in the current context, but will
      be bound in the nearest block, which is delimited by { ... }.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blocks are just syntactic sugar for anonymous functions, whose parameters
      are defined by the explicit bindings that appear to their left in the
      code. In the above example, the block { x } would be desugared to (x) =>
      x, the anonymous function of one argument x that just returns x.
    </p>
    <p>
      More explicitly, whenever a function f is called with a block as its
      argument, this function acts as a “binder”: The block will consume all the
      bindings that occur as arguments of f (or as arguments to arguments of f
      and so forth) before the block. A block never receives bindings that come
      from “above” the binder f in the syntax tree, which makes binders act as
      scopes:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// this binds `x => x + x` to f, then calls f(2)
let('f, fn('x, { x + x }), { f(2) })
//   |      \__________/          |
//   |       scope of x           |
//   \____________________________/
//           scope of f
//
// { x + x } is desugared to x => x + x
// { f(2) } is desugared to f => f(2)</code></pre>
    <h1>Implementing a Binding Construct</h1>
    <p>
      So far, so good. But how can <em>binders</em>, functions that accept
      blocks, be implemented in such a way that they can bind explicit bindings
      to the right values? Let's return to the hypothetical binding construct
      for pattern matching and let's look at its arguments in turn:
    </p>
    <pre><code>match(
    v,            // a value, resolved before passed to `match`
    Pair('x, 'x), // ???
    { x }         // desugared to a normal function, x => x
)</code></pre>
    <p>
      A binder is just a normal function, not a macro, and so the first
      argument, v, is resolved in the current scope and its value is passed to
      the match function. The block { x } is transformed into an anonymous
      function, as discussed, and then passed to the match function as its last
      argument. The transformation to an anonymous function needs only static
      information and can thus be done during parsing, the target language only
      needs to support anonymous functions. But what about Pair('x, 'x)?
    </p>
    <p>
      An explicit binding is turned into a special value that can be compared
      for equality, but never unwrapped. The two 'x in Pair('x, 'x) can thus be
      compared and will be equal, whereas the bindings in Pair('x, 'y) would not
      be equal. The parser needs to ensure that explicit bindings in different
      scopes need to become different values, such as in this example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// in pseudo JS syntax:
let just_the_binding = (binding, _block) => binding;
let y = just_the_binding('x, { x });
let z = just_the_binding('x, { x });
y == z // false</code></pre>
    <p>
      Even though both bindings are called “'x”, they come from different scopes
      and are thus different. This, together with the requirement that the name
      of bindings can never be accessed, guarantees that they behave like
      variables and that renaming a binding never changes the behavior of a
      program.
    </p>
    <h1>Runtime Reflection</h1>
    <p>
      There's one more requirement if we want to make the match(v, Pair('x, 'x),
      { x }) example work: Pair('x, 'x) cannot be a struct that is sealed off
      and can only be accessed if its name and number of fields are known.
      Instead, the match function needs to inspect it at runtime and split it
      into its constituent parts: the name “Pair” and a list of fields that can
      be iterated over. This requires some form of runtime reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value Pair('x, 'x) that is passed to the match function is then simply
      a pair that stores two bindings as its fields. It is the match function's
      job to figure out that only one binding was used in the pattern, because
      the block { x } is desugared to x => x and thus expects a single argument.
      If the pattern had been Pair('x, 'y) the block { x } would have been
      desugared to (x, y) => x, expecting two arguments. Using runtime
      reflection, the match function can ensure that it always calls the block
      with the right number of arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a possible alternative that does not require support for runtime
      reflection: When a binder function call is parsed, for example when the
      call match(v, Pair('x, 'x), { x }) is parsed, the parser could
      <em>statically</em> destructure arguments that aren't blocks into a custom
      representation that exposes its structure without reflection, such as:
    </p>
    <pre><code>// using Rust-like syntax:
Struct {
    name: "Pair",
    fields: [
        Binding('x),
        Binding('x)
    ]
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Not requiring runtime reflection might seem appealing, but comes at a
      cost: It is a leaky abstraction, because the parser can only destructure
      what it sees <em>statically:</em>
    </p>
    <pre><code>// without reflection, `p` appears atomic to the parser
let p = Pair(1, 2);
match(v, p, { ... })</code></pre>
    <p>
      In the above code, pattern matching could only be implemented if there's
      already a way to compare aggregate data structures for equality and if
      this built-in form of equality is sufficient. But if we for example want
      to implement a custom pattern matching construct that can unify Pair(1.0,
      1.0) with Pair(1, 1) but the built-in equality does not support coercion
      between ints and floats, we're out of luck.
    </p>
    <h1>Under the Hood</h1>
    <p>
      Here's a sketch for a lower level language that is deliberately simple but
      supports just enough runtime reflection that explicit bindings and custom
      binding constructs can be built on top of it:
    </p>
    <pre><code>t = var                                       // variable
  | var "=>" t                                // abstraction
  | t "(" t ")"                               // application
  | tag                                       // tag
  | "if" t "is" t "then" t "else" t           // conditional
  | "with" t "as" var "," var "do" t "else" t // destructure</code></pre>
    <p>
      The first three lines are just standard lambda calculus: We can build
      multi-argument functions using currying, using “(x, y) => x” as sugar for
      “x => y => x”, and call functions, using “f(x, y)” as sugar for
      “(f(x))(y)”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tags, starting with an uppercase letter to distinguish them from
      variables, are interned strings (known as keywords, atoms or symbols in
      other languages) and can be applied to other values to form simple data
      structures: “Foo(bar, baz)” is the tag “Foo” applied to “bar”, then
      applied to “baz”. A simple if-is-then-else can compare two atomic tags
      (but not tags applied to other values) for equality:
    </p>
    <pre><code>if Foo is Foo then True else False           // True
if Foo is Bar then True else False           // False
if Foo(Bar) is Foo(Bar) then True else False // False, not atomic</code></pre>
    <p>
      To destructure aggregate values, the with-as-do-else form has to be used,
      which will pop off the <em>last</em> field of a data structure (the last
      value to be applied):
    </p>
    <pre><code>with Foo(Bar, Baz) as xs, x do // xs = Foo(Bar), x = Baz
    Pair(xs, x)                // Pair(Foo(Bar), Baz)
else
    ...</code></pre>
    <p>
      This is just enough to implement higher level constructs (such as equality
      for aggregate data structures) using custom binding constructs. To do
      that, the above calculus has to be exposed as <em>special forms</em>: The
      parser automatically translates them into the underlying language, but
      special forms can be reimplemented as and shadowed by normal functions.
      Variables and function application do not need special forms, the other
      constructs do:
    </p>
    <pre><code>fn('x, { body })                       // abstraction
if(x, y, { then }, { else })           // conditional
with(value, 'xs, 'x, { do }, { else }) // destructure</code></pre>
    <p>
      While the lower level language does not distinguish between tags and
      bindings, the higher level language needs a way to distinguish between
      these two types of values without exposing the internals of bindings
      (which would make their names observable and violate the desired
      guarantees).
    </p>
    <p>
      The easiest way to do this is to let the parser never produce atomic tags,
      but always wrap tags and bindings in special type tags. A tag “Foo” thus
      becomes TAG(Foo), whereas the binding “'x” becomes BINDING(...), wrapping
      a tag that is guaranteed to be different from an 'x in a different scope.
      The two types of values can then be distinguished using two more
      functions, which can be implemented in terms of the others:
    </p>
    <pre><code>if-tag(x, { then }, { else })
if-binding(x, { then }, { else })</code></pre>
    <p>
      As long as there is no way to construct bindings other than wherever the
      parser converts an explicit binding (that is to say, there must be no way
      to dynamically turn a non-binding value into a binding), it is safe to use
      the available reflection to destructure tags and bindings and compare
      their inner tags with others for equality (assuming that tags and bindings
      use different prefixes / namespaces).
    </p>
    <p>
      And that's it! This should be enough to implement custom binding
      constructs using only statically resolved scopes and bindings. The syntax
      is quite bare and leaves a lot to be desired, but that's a topic for
      another time.
